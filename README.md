# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo.

**Warning:** My username is hardcoded into many of these configurations.


## Basic Usage

`implode.sh` moves dotfiles from around the system into the repo.

`install.sh` installs the dotfiles into the system.

`backup.sh` backs up large non-configuration files (e.g `~/.Goland*`) to Google Drive.
